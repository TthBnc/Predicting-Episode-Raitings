# The Office - Episode Prediction

## This app makes a prediction of an episode's rating based on the user input.

**Dataset:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehaprabhavalkar/the-office-dataset \
**Web Frontend:** https://tthbnc-geptan-streamlit-199oe3.streamlit.app \
(may need to wait a few minutes to wake the app if it hasn't been used for a while) \

Cleaned the dataset, then used StandardScaler on the remaining fields. Tried out several models then implemented the NeuralNetwork one into a streamlit frontend. \
For more insight on the process used, please check out the [Predicting Episode Ratings](./Predicting Episode ratings.pptx) slideshow!
